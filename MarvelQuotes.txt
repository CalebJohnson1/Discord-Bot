> ""King of Space." "Master of the Sun." You claim such vast domains. Is it to balance your small souls? Could I not lay claim to the light and the void, if I wished it? Have I not earned such titles? I, who have mastered all arts, all sciences, all secrets? Whose technology and magic cross the stars as easily as they scramble an alpha telepath's mind? Who would dare to say I have not earned the right? Yet I am king of a simple nation. On a simple planet. A beloved garden tended by iron hands. And the only title I have ever claimed... is doctor." name: **Doctor Doom**
> "Humanity will fight and die for control over a couple of stones. We will never be free of their burden. So I gave each stone a soul of its own. They will lead their own individual lives. Write their own destinies. Years ago the Soul Gem gave me a soul. Now I think I know why. It's so that I could give that same gift now. These souls will protect themselves or die trying. And if they do, we will be right back here again. In the same story." name: **Adam Warlock**

> "Hope you were watching, Uncle Ben. 'Cause I did that for you. Kept everyone safe. Kept them from being scared. And I made it fun. It doesn't matter that most of 'em wouldn't have lifted a finger for Peter Parker. That's not why you do it. You do it 'cause it's the right thing to do. Because it's what you would've done. You were more than a father to me, Ben Parker. More than a role model...You were my hero. Now it's my turn. Because from now on, I'm going to be yours! You'll see. I'm going to give it my all! We'll have fun! I'll never quit--and it's going to be amazing!" name: **Spider-Man (Peter Parker)**
> "All that peace I felt is gone. I ruin it because I can. Because it's easy. I've fought for Preston. For the Camachos. I've fought for my friends. I've tried to make these people not just safe, but happy. I didn't go looking for these people. They walked into my life. And now the imbalance is restored. I've fought for the happiness of everyone around me. I've been willing to die for that happiness. I now realize I've never experienced happiness. I put on a good show... I simply don't know the meaning of the word... And I never will." name: **Deadpool**

The historians, the students, the gray beards, they come in the wake of the strong and write down what the brave have done! But it is the conquerors who change the world!" name: **Kang the Conqueror**
> "Such bluster. How very typical. Ever the sheltered son. So many fractured delusions. You know nothing of war. For all these countless millennia when it comes to the two of us, you seem to have avoided the simplest of conclusions. Instead, you feel the incessant need to avenge every wrong you perceive from your position of languid morality...as if it were some sort of game. Quite sad. But if it's a war you truly desire, Thor, then Loki can happily provide." name: **Loki Laufeyson**
> "Am I not Thanos! Did I not butcher the woman who gave me birth, who force fed me into this hell called life?! Is not the wake of my passing crimson with the blood of my enemies and allies alike?! Death is with me every second of the day! My every moment is spent in either dealing out death or worshiping it! So tell me, who under the stars is better suited than I to be Death's consort?" name: **Thanos**

> "A new Goblin, just what the world needs. I don't know who's behind the mask this time, but he'd better watch out. I won't have to raise a finger after Parker's been through with the "real" Goblin. Parker won't let another Goblin hurt anyone ever again. I pity this guy, he just picked up the wrong duds." name: **Nicholas Fury**
> "Sooner or later, all human beings have to face the truth about themselves. The difference between who we are and who we think we are." name: **Nicholas Fury**
> "My theory... Listen to me. This chaos magic, the source of her new "reality altering powers..." I am the master of the mystic arts, and I am telling you... there's no such thing as chaos magic. Please forget we are talking about your friend. And listen to me tell you the story of an orphaned mutant with a sordid, violent past... with powers she did not earn nor can she control... Powers she never fully understood. Can you understand the delicate mindset of a woman, a person, who has control over reality? It means reality controls her. Imagination becomes the enemy. Structure disappears. Reality, eventually, as she knows it, starts to slip away. Elude her. Blur. Drama, conflic, tragedy. They become excuses to change the world to fit the image that she has for it. Anything she doesn't like, she can change. No matter how slight. People. Places. Things. Everything is hers to change. But every time she does that, every time she gives in to her desires, no matter how noble they may be... a little more of her slips away. She loses herself. Her reason. But she struggles quietly every day to keep it in check, to keep it all together. For a person of strong mind and body, for a person of pure spirit... the task of coping with these powers would be all consuming. But here's a woman for whom, by the nature of her upbringing and occupation... every day is stressful, chaotic... and after a life lived with lost love, violence, and drama, what does she do? She says to herself: "I deserve happiness. I want to bring something into this world that is good. That I can love." And she gives birth to children... even though she can't. She played mommy to make herself feel like someone she thinks is normal. And that ends tragically as well? If I told you a story like this, you'd say to yourself, this sounds like a person who has lost control of themselves on a deep psychological level. You'd say this sounds like a disturbed person. Now does anything I have describe not sound like Wanda Maximoff?" name: **Doctor Strange**

There's an instant, a fraction of a second before the world catches hold of her again... a moment when she's outrun every doubt and fear she's ever had about herself and she flies. In that one moment, every little girl flies. I need to find that again. Like taking a car out into the desert to see how fast it can go, I need to find the edge of me... and maybe, if I fly far enough, I'll be able to turn around and look at the world... and see where I belong." name: **Captain Marvel**

> "You're a good cop, dad. You put on that badge and carry that gun because you know if you don't someone who shouldn't will. When I put on this mask, I only did it because it freed me from responsibility. I thought I was special. And Peter Parker died because he tried to follow my example. I have to take responsibility for that. To make his death mean something. But I can't do it in a jail cell. This mask is my badge now. If I don't define what it means... monsters like this will. This is where I'm needed most." name: **Gwen Stacy (Spider-Woman)**
> "Why can't we all just get along? The fighting, there is no reason for it. There's never been a reason. There never will be a reason. It's one thing for humans to never learn that.. their lifespans are short, you turn your head for just a moment, and an entire generation has gone by. But why can't the other Eternals dumb out what I've known since the Pleistocene." name: **Sersi**

I used to believe in universal contraction. Entropy and the end of all things. Well, I changed my mind. I'm letting go. Because now I believe in expansion. I believe we endure. Don't you see?
